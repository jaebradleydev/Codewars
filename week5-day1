The Hamming Distance is a measure of similarity between two strings of equal length. Complete the function so that it returns the number of positions where the input strings do not match.

Examples:
a = "I like turtles"
b = "I like turkeys"
Result: 3

a = "Hello World"
b = "Hello World"
Result: 0

a = "espresso"
b = "Expresso"
Result: 2
You can assume that the two input strings are of equal length.
****************************************************************************


function hamming(a,b) {
  //We can use a number variable of 0 to hold the "tally" of non-matching characters
  var mismatchCount = 0;
	// Next, a for loop will iterate through the indices of string a to compare w/the corresponding indices of string b. Those that don't match will add (+=1) to the mismatchCount
  for (i=0;i<a.length;i++){
    if (a[i]!==b[i]) mismatchCount+=1
  } 
  return mismatchCount
}
