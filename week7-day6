You are given a secret message you need to decipher. Here are the things you need to know to decipher it:

For each word:

the second and the last letter is switched (e.g. Hello becomes Holle)
the first letter is replaced by its character code (e.g. H becomes 72)
Note: there are no special characters used, only letters and spaces

Examples

decipherThis('72olle 103doo 100ya'); // 'Hello good day'
decipherThis('82yade 115te 103o'); // 'Ready'


function decipherThis(str) {
//We can turn the string into an array to map a new word onto each old one, which parses the integer that begins each word and replaces it with it's Unicode letter
  //We'll then concatenate the Unicode letter and the remainder of the word, using the slice method to swap the appropriate letters
  return str.split(' ').map(x => {
          let num = parseInt(x);
          let word = x.replace(num,'');
    if (word.length === 1) return String.fromCharCode(num) + word;
        return String.fromCharCode(num) + word.slice(-1) + word.slice(1, -1) + word.slice(0, 1)
    })
  .join(' ')
};
