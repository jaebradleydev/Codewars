function saleHotdogs(n){

  var priceOfHotdogs
  //The first condition will multiply the number ordered by the rate for n < 5
  if (n < 5) {
    priceOfHotdogs = 100 * n
  //Next, we'll set the rate for a double-condition--tested for at once w/ the && operator
  } else if (n >= 5 && n < 10) {
    priceOfHotdogs = 95 * n
  //Last condition will be for thing single condition of n >= 10
