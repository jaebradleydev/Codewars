Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.

arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]


********************************************************************************

function arrayDiff(a, b) {
//add filter method to array a
//arrow function: parameter x (representing each item of the array in turn) goes into includes method appended to array b to be "searched for"
//we'll use the bang ! to "search" for items NOT found in array b, as thats what we want to end up with
  return a.filter(x => !b.includes(x))
}
