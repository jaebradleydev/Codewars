DESCRIPTION:
Your task is to find the nearest square number, nearest_sq(n), of a positive integer n.


function nearestSq(n){
    //Squares are integers and squareroots are integers, thus we can use floor and ceil methods to find the closest values to n
  
    //We can find the next closest integer to the squareroot of n by taking the difference between the integer above and below the sqrt of n
  
    //Whichever difference is smaller will produce the closer square (because multiplication won't change the distance), and we can return this value by using ? and returning an answer based on whichever end is closer

    return (Math.sqrt(n)-Math.floor(Math.sqrt(n))) > (Math.ceil(Math.sqrt(n)) - Math.sqrt(n)) ? Math.pow(Math.ceil(Math.sqrt(n)),2) : Math.pow(Math.floor(Math.sqrt(n)),2)
}
