DESCRIPTION:
Your task, is to create NÃ—N multiplication table, of size provided in parameter.

For example, when given size is 3:

1 2 3
2 4 6
3 6 9
For the given example, the return value should be:

[[1,2,3],[2,4,6],[3,6,9]]


multiplicationTable = function(size) {
  //The final result will be a 2D array, so we'll declare the outer array
  var finalArrayGroup = [];
  //Next, we can use a for loop to create *size* number of arrays in the second dimension. A second variable can have each value pushed into it, then get pushed to the outer array
  for (i=1; i<=size; i++) {
    var multipleArr = [];
  //Within the loop, we'll create another loop to push each i value's multiples up to size no. of elements. This is essentially the first loop's current index times the second loop's current index 
  //For ex. on the first array (first inner array), we'll push the multiples of 1 (1*1, 1*2, 1*3...). This will be the outer current index*inner current index, here i*j
    for (j=1; j<=size; j++) {
      multipleArr.push(j*i)
    }
    
    finalArrayGroup.push(multipleArr)
  }
  return finalArrayGroup
}
