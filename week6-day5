A Narcissistic Number (or Armstrong Number) is a positive number which is the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits in a given base. In this Kata, we will restrict ourselves to decimal (base 10).

For example, take 153 (3 digits), which is narcissistic:

    1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153
and 1652 (4 digits), which isn't:

    1^4 + 6^4 + 5^4 + 2^4 = 1 + 1296 + 625 + 16 = 1938


function narcissistic(value) {
  // We can create a few variables: 1) one to convert the number paramenter to a string to apply a for loop and 2) a variable to hold a sum of numbers, necessary to identify a narcissistic number
  var valueString= String(value);
  var sumTotal = 0;
  // Now, we'll use a for loop to move through the value as a string and take each digit to the power of the number of digits in the value, and send each product to the sum variable
  for (i=0; i<valueString.length; i++){
    var digit= Number(valueString[i]);
    sumTotal+= Math.pow(digit, valueString.length)
  }
  //Now that each digit value has been added, we can compare the sum to the original number and use a ternary operator to return true or false to whether the number is narcissistic (value == sum of each digit raised to (# of digits) power)
  return value==sumTotal ?  true : false
}
