DESCRIPTION:
There's a "3 for 2" (or "2+1" if you like) offer on mangoes. For a given quantity and price (per mango), calculate the total cost of the mangoes.

Examples
mango(2, 3) ==> 6    # 2 mangoes for $3 per unit = $6; no mango for free
mango(3, 3) ==> 6    # 2 mangoes for $3 per unit = $6; +1 mango for free
mango(5, 3) ==> 12   # 4 mangoes for $3 per unit = $12; +1 mango for free
mango(9, 5) ==> 30   # 6 mangoes for $5 per unit = $30; +3 mangoes for free

function mango(quantity, price){
 //It will take at least 3 items to get the deal, so a quantity lower than that will be standard price
  if (quantity<3)
    return quantity*price
 //Anything from 3 items up can be calculated by adding 2/3rd's the price of any multiple of 3 plus the price of whatever the remainder is (which is just the number of mangoes that isn't in a group of 3 for the deal)
  else
    return ((quantity - quantity%3)*price)*(2/3)+quantity%3*price
}


// UPDATED SOLUTION

function mango(quantity, price){
   return ((quantity - quantity%3)*price)*(2/3)+quantity%3*price
}
