Coding in function tailAndHead. function accept 1 parameter arr(a number array).

We use an example to explain this task:

You got an array [123,456,789,12,34,56,78].

First, from left to right, the tail of an element and the head of the next element are added together. The results are put into an array. like this:

[123,456,789,1 2,3 4,5 6,78]
   3+4 6+7 9+1 2+3 4+5 6+7  
    |   |   |   |   |   |
   [7 ,13 ,10 , 5 , 9 ,13]
And then, Calculate their product and return it(7x13x10x5x9x13=532350)

So, tailAndHead([123,456,789,12,34,56,78]) should return 532350 

All elements of arr are positive integer. If a number is less than 10, its head and tail are the same. Please try to use reduce() solve this kata.

Examples
tailAndHead([1,2,3,4,5]) should return 945
tailAndHead([111,2345,66,78,900]) should return 7293
tailAndHead([35456,782,569,2454,875]) should return 12012



function tailAndHead(arr){
  //First, we can create a new empty array to use to reassign its soon-to-be elements as the sum of digits from  the original arraythe 
  let headAndTail = [];

  //The sum/new array elements and be created by looping through the original array and selecting the last and first respective digits of the current index and the next index in string form then adding their numberized forms
  for (i=0; i < arr.length-1; i++) {
     headAndTail[i] = Number(arr[i].toString()[arr[i].toString().length-1]) + Number(arr[i+1].toString()[0]);
  };
  //Last, we can reduce the final array by multiplying the current and previous values to get their product, per the task
  return headAndTail.reduce((a,b)=> (a*b))
}
