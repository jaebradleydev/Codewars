DESCRIPTION:
To find the volume (centimeters cubed) of a cuboid you use the formula:

volume = Length * Width * Height

But someone forgot to use proper record keeping, so we only have the volume, and the length of a single side!

It's up to you to find out whether the cuboid has equal sides (= is a cube).

Return true if the cuboid could have equal sides, return false otherwise.

Return false for invalid numbers too (e.g volume or side is less than or equal to 0).

Note: side will be an integer



var cubeChecker = function(volume, side){
  //if side is not positive, it will not yield a cube
  //secondly, we can determine whether any resultant shape is a cube by determining whether length*height*width equal the volume and are all equal to the 'side' parameter (equal in value)
  if (side <= 0) return false;
  else return side*side*side===volume ? true:false;
};
