DESCRIPTION:
Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each. If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.

Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.




function lovefunc(flower1, flower2){
  // If one flower has an odd # of petals and the other an even #, the total # of petals between them is divisible by 2 with a remainder of 1. With this is mind, if we add the remainders of the two variables of petal number, a couple in love will always have a total of 1 petal as a remainder. This translates to [remainder of first flower] + [remainder of second flower] == 1.
  if (flower1%2 + flower2%2 == 1) return true;
  else return false
}
