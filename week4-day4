In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.

Examples
highAndLow("1 2 3 4 5");  // return "5 1"
highAndLow("1 2 -3 4 5"); // return "5 -3"
highAndLow("1 9 3 4 -5"); // return "9 -5"
Notes
All numbers are valid Int32, no need to validate them.
There will always be at least one number in the input string.
Output string must be two numbers separated by a single space, and highest number is first.


function highAndLow(numbers){
  // We can set a few variables to hold the two selected number values, to later join with a space using concatenation
  let var1;
  let var2;
  // We'll use split to convert the string to an array, then we can sort them by number order and return the lowest and highest value/index
  let numberArray = numbers.split(" ")
  
  numberArray.sort((a,b)=> a-b)
  
  var1 = numberArray[numberArray.length-1];
  var2 = numberArray[0];
  
  return var1+" "+var2
}
