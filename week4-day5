DESCRIPTION:
Write a function that takes a positive integer n, sums all the cubed values from 1 to n (inclusive), and returns that sum.

Assume that the input n will always be a positive integer.

Examples: (Input --> output)

2 --> 9 (sum of the cubes of 1 and 2 is 1 + 8)
3 --> 36 (sum of the cubes of 1, 2, and 3 is 1 + 8 + 27)


function sumCubes(n){
  // We can use a for loop to use the index number value to cube each number from 0 to n
  // We can add each cube to a variable that holds the total
  var cubedValuesTotal = 0;
  for (i=0;i<=n;i++){
    cubedValuesTotal += i*i*i
  }
  return cubedValuesTotal
}
